## Odin Project
This page was built using [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).
The intent of this project was to build a calculator that had all the functions of a basic calculator. (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with backspace and clear buttons.

## Challenges
Now further along in my javascript-logic journey, this project was much more advanced project than I had come across up to this point so the logic took much longer to get right.
In hindsight, I would've done this project differently, utilizing a more object-oriented approach. Doing this approach would've make the comparisons much easier as the 2 numbers would be much easier to track and identify.
